title: "Not a blank page"
---

It is not a perfectly blank page, that place in the mind on which the senses record their impressions, but comes with certain inbuilt properties.

There are three interesting questions concerning these inbuilt properties. First, The degree to which these properties mutate the messages; second, Whether the properties themselves can be mutated (_ie_ reprogrammed); and third, Whether there are similarities from one individual to the next (and this last is the theme of much of Joseph Campbell’s thought).

After for a long while being uninterested despite the cacophany of mentions of Joseph Campbell’s work—you might be led to believe the universe was trying hard to tell me something—I finally had my first taste of his writing, and _Oh, what fortune!_, because I find it to be so exceptionally compelling, I think I may have found in Mr. Campbell another kindred spirit. So makes space, Thoreau.
