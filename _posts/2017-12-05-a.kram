When we regard ugly things we make ourselves ugly.
Both beauty and its lack are in the eye.
The eye that is attracted to beautiful things becomes skilled at appreciating
all it gazes upon.
But the eye that notices what is ugly, it becomes skilled at perceiving what is
wrong.
It *depreciates* all it sees, and such a way of seeing is universally unwelcome.
