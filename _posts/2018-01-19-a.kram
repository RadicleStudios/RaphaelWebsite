If I think about the kind of conversation I really enjoy, I recall something
Thoreau wrote.
He was describing how he conversed with an important visitor.
"We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the
fishes of thought were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the
bank, but came and went grandly, like the clouds which float through the western
sky, and the mother-oâ€™-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there."
