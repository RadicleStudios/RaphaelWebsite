title: Feeling connected

At this moment, I am close to tears from the feeling of being part of the
collective consciousness.
When I focus my actions and operations within, and resolve to work through
desirous, fearful, or delusive ideas; the mirror in the world without is
astounding.
It is forming the strong impression on my intellect, emotions, and spirit, that
I am indeed perceiving a greater reality than is commonly comprehended.
