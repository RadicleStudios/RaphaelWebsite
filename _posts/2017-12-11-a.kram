title: Finding the courage to be curious
---

Curiosity, my highest pleasure.
It'd do me good to indulge more.
But I admit my curiosity does not enjoy a free expression.

Awareness often discovers the absurdity of life.
Petty fears arrest or encumber the bold striving my curiosity urges.
But my greatest fear yet orients me rightly.
I am most afraid of developing habits of thought and action that are not
courageous.
In other words, it is becoming *distracted* that I am most afraid of.
