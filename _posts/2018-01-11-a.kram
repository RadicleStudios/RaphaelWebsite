title: "Indefatigable discernment"
---

Emerson reminds me that trying to make something of myself leads to a blindness
of the intellect and weakness of the will.
So how do I become great, not trying to make something of myself?
I don't know but I must drop all thinking, I think, and bring an indefatigable
and exacting discernment to all the thoughts I permit to compose the theme of my
spiritual intention.
