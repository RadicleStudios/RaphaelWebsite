"Within man is the soul of the whole, the wise silence, the universal beauty, to
which every part and particle is equally related, the eternal One.
When it breathes through his intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through
his will, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love."
(Emerson)
