Listening to the audiobook _The Practice of Lojong: Cultivating Compassion
through Training the Mind_, by Traleg Kyabgon, a wonderful passage urged notice:

"Not to listen is to be like a pot turned upside down.
Not to be able to retain what you hear is to be like a pot with a hole in it.
To mix negative emotions with what you hear is to be a pot with poison in it."

It makes me think how judgmental I am.
