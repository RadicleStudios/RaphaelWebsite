title: "How to properly entertain an absence of desire"

But why even do so? Because there's something I want you to see.
Because desire goes together with suffering, and suffering clouds your view.

Desire operates with the smallest things.
That's what I want to tell you today.
It operates every moment, without your permission.
You *prefer*.
And from chronic preferring your eyes are closed.

Someone needs to slap you.
