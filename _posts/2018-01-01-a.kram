title: New beginnings
---

My good friend tells me, his hands indicating our connection,\\
a fever in his mind, "It's okay for this to be broken."\\
Yes, it's okay.\\
It's okay also that that hurts me.

To be hurt, and to say it;\\
one man to another, not hiding tears:\\
It makes me smile how much this means\\
I've met a brave new beginning.
