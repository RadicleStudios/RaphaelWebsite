title: A Place to Stand
---

Long have I searched for a place to stand where my viewpoint includes every
possible viewpoint.

I am reminded of Thoreau's opinion, "Could a greater miracle ever take place
than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?"
That is why I am starting my podcast.
There is nothing that interests me more than seeing life from different angles.
