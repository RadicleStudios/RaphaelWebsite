A mother will move with surprising swiftness to catch her child from running too
close to the road.
The child runs forward happy and reckless, limbs akimbo, but the parent is
always on the alert.
The weary parent will sooner install an echo of herself in the child's mind, a
voice of concern that keeps the child safe.
