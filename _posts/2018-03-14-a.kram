I remember---and I need constant reminders---that what I really desire is to
learn, to contribute, to create; or in other words, to *love*, which verb
includes all those things.
And I need a constant reminder because it seems I automatically close up.
I keep having to remind myself that _vulnerable_ is not something to be avoided,
it's the feeling I want!
