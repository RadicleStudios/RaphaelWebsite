title: "Sniper focus"
---

I read in David Amerland's _The Sniper Mind_ that snipers learn the three
pillars of self-belief to be, I, Passion, II, Purpose, and III, Persistence.

Accepting this invitation, I can describe my passion as an infinite love and
curiosity; my purpose, being directed to cultivating conversations that lead to
appreciative and empowering viewpoints; and my persistence, the vigilance of
indestructible wakefulness, the discipline never to stop doing what I am up to.
